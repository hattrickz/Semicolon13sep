2.7 Fill in the blanks of the following statements:
a) A comment is used to document a program and improve its readability.

b) A decision can be made in a Java program with an if statement.

c) The arithmetic operators with the same precedence as multiplication are division and remainder.

d) When parentheses in an arithmetic expression are nested, the innermost set of parentheses is evaluated first.

e) A location in the computer's memory that may contain different values at various times throughout the execution of a program is called a variable.

2.8 Write java statements that accomplish each of the following tasks:
 .a) Display the message "Enter an integer:", leaving the cursor on the same line.

public class Main {
	public static void main (String [] args){
        System.out.println("Enter an integer: "); 
}

} 

.b) Assign the product of variables b and c to the int variable a.

public class Main {
	public static void main (String [] args){
	int b = 20;
        int c = 80;
        int  a = (b * c);

        System.out.println(a); 
}

}

.c) Use a comment to state that a program performs a sample payroll calculation.

   // this program performs a sample payroll calculation

2.9 state whether each of the following is true or false. if false, explain why.
.a) addittion is executed first in the following expression: a * b/(c + d) * 5.

	false. because parentheses is evalauted first before any other operation

.b) The following are valid variables names: Accountvalue, value,value_in_, ac-count_no_1234, US$, her_sales_in_$, his_checking_account, x,_,a@b, and _name.

	false. variable names can't start with a number,signs and cannot contain underscroll etc 

.c) in 2 + 3 + 5 / 4, addition has the highest precedence.

 	false. cause division has higher precedence than addition. the division 5/4 should be done before before any addition 

.d) The following are all invalid variable names: name@email.com,87, x%, 99er, and 2_.	
	
	true. because it has @, . x%, % and also starts with numbers

2.10 Assuming that x = 5 and y = 1, what does each of the following statements display?

.a)System.out.printf("x = %d%n",x + 5);
	displays x = 10.

.b)System.out.printf("value of %d is *%d is %d%n",x,y,(x*y));
	displays value of 5 is *1 is 5

.c)System.out.printf("x is %d and y is %d",x,y);
	displays x is 5 and y is 1


.d)System.out.printf("%d is not equal to %d%n", (x + y),(x * y));
       display x is 5 and y is 16 is not equal to 5

2.11 which of the following Java statements contain variables whose values are not modified?

a) int m = (p + 2) + 3;. The statement assigns a new value to m, but p's value isn't changed.

b) System.out.println("m = m + 1");. The code prints a string.

c) int m = p / 2;. The statement assigns a new value to m, but the p value is not changed.

d) int j = k + 2;. This statement assigns a new value to j, but the k value is not changed.

a, c, and d) are the java statement that contain cannot be modified


2.13 What is the output that will be printed after execution of the following Java code snippet?
The code snippet is:
int p = 5;
System.out.printf("%d", p + 2 * 4);
System.out.printf("%d", p * 2 + 4);
The output will be:
1314
the first printf 2 * 4 is evaluated first due to precedence and result is 8. Then 5 + 8 which is 13.
and the second printf p * 2 is evaluated first which is 5 * 2 = 10. Then 10 + 4 is 14.
Since printf does not automatically add a newline, the output of the two statements appears on the same line.

2.19 What does the following code print?
System.out.printf(" ****%n  *****%n   *******%n  *****%n    ****%n");
all the argument compiled in next line because each argument has its own format specifier to compile in next line.

2.20 What does the following code print?
System.out.println("*");
System.out.println(" *** ");
System.out.println("  ***** ");
System.out.println("   **** ");
System.out.println(" ** ");

This code prints each println statement on a new line.

2.21 What does the following code print?**
java
System.out.print("*");
System.out.print("***");
System.out.print("*****");
System.out.print("****");
System.out.println("**");

It will print every print statement on a single line 


2.22 What does the following code print?**
java
System.out.println("*");
System.out.println("***");
System.out.println("*****");
System.out.println("****");
System.out.println("**");

This code prints each println statement on a new line.

2.23 What does the following code print?
System.out.printf("%s%n%s%n%s%n%s%n",  "*", "***", "*****", "***", "*");

This code prints four argument and ignore the last one. because the are more argument than format specifiers


2.25 (Divisible by 3)

import java.util.Scanner;

public class DivisibleBy3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
              Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
	      System.out.print("Enter an integer: ");
        int number = input.nextInt();

        if (number % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println(number + " is divisible by 3.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is not divisible by 3.");
        }

        input.close();
    }
}
i use if-else statement to print whether the number is divisible by 3 or not.
